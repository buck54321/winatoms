    <h2 id="contractAnchor">The Contract</h2>
      A challenge is a contract that exists on the Decred blockchain.
      You fund the contract when you pay to the challenge's address.
      To redeem the contract funds, the player must provide 2 things, the
      <strong>game key</strong> and the
      <strong>solution hash</strong>. 
      
      The <span class="bold">solution hash</span> is the SHA-256 hash of the UTF-8
      encoded solution. The redeem script, which defines the contract, looks
      like this.

      <div class="contract-mono">
        SHA256 <32-bytes solution double-hash> EQUALVERIFY <32-bytes game key pubkey> CHECKSIG
      </div>

      The redeemer must provide two inputs to the redeem script.

      <div class="contract-mono">
        <32-bytes signature> <32-bytes solution hash>
      </div>

      The contract says, in essence
      <ol>
        <li>
          Hash the redeemer-supplied <strong>solution hash</strong>, creating a <strong>double-hash</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Check that the <strong>double-hash</strong> created in 1 matches the redeem script's <strong>contract double-hash</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Verify that the <strong>signature</strong> provided is valid, proving access to the <strong>game key</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2 id="securityAnchor">Security</h2>
      <p>
        The important cryptographic operations that secure the contract are
        performed on your computer before submitting the challenge data. 
        The <strong>game key</strong>, however, is generated and stored by
        <span class="logo-font">Win Atoms!</span> and the challenge creator.
        The details of the contract are encoded in the <strong>game key</strong>, but not the <strong>solution</strong>.
        The redeemer must have both the <strong>solution</strong> and the <strong>game key</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, the challenge creator can always solve their own challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="logo-font">Win Atoms!</span> never collects a <strong>solution</strong>.
        We use a cryptographic process to collect proof that the redeemer knows
        the solution. Once the redeemer can prove that they know the <strong>solution</strong>,
        <span class="logo-font">Win Atoms!</span> provides the redeemer with the
        a <strong>transaction template</strong>, from which the final transaction can be assembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user chooses to use the <strong>instant redeem</strong> feature to relay their
        transaction, <span class="logo-font">Win Atoms!</span> does have access
        to the <strong>solution</strong> and the <strong>game key</strong> simultaneously, so could, in theory,
        steal the solution at that point. While it's hard to completely prove that we're on
        the up-and-up, our code is open-source, and you can see the important part right
        <a href="https://github.com/buck54321/winatoms/blob/232e39f1c11f8dd20c1aa2d35f550b4f0c3ec40a/challenges.py#L815-L819">here</a>,
        if you're curious. If that's not good enough, you should manually
        verify your transaction by copy-pasting into <a href="https://explorer.dcrdata.org">dcrdata</a>, or
        use <span class="mono fs16">dcrctl decoderawtransaction</span>, and then broadcasting.
